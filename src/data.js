      "I had the pleasure of working with Spencer at Grove Collaborative. Spencer is thoughtful, eager, curious, and is a quick learner. Spencer volunteered to fill a real need in our acquisition team on top of his normal duties. He learned how to build and test Facebook Ads and got up to speed on our process even faster than I thought was possible. He took it on himself to become an expert. He is deliberate, thoughtful and creative in his work. He impressed me on multiple occasions by proactively looking for new ways to improve our process. He is a self-starter and would be a strong asset to almost any organization. I hope to work with Spencer again in the future and I'm excited to see what he does over his career.",

Spencer's dedication to learning his craft inspired me to follow in his steps. There isn't someone who's more hard working than Spencer that I'd recommend!",
